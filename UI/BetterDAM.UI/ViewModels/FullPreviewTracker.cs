/// Pulled out of the ViewModel because getting it wrong is invisible until it is infuriating. The
/// first version tracked only "what did we last ask for", which conflated two different questions —
/// *is a decode already running for this?* and *do we already have this?* — into one field. Any run
/// that ended without delivering (the selection moved, the decode was cancelled, the file turned out
/// to be a video) left that field set with nothing behind it, and every later request was then
/// dismissed as redundant. The picture stayed on its embedded JPEG until something happened to clear
/// the field by hand.
///
/// Three separate pieces of state, so no single one has to mean two things:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><see cref="InFlight"/> — a decode is running for this file. Cleared when the run ends,
/// however it ends.</item>
/// <item><see cref="Delivered"/> — a decode has produced pixels for this file under the current
/// rendering. Cleared when the rendering changes.</item>
/// <item><see cref="Held"/> — which file the pixels in hand belong to, which is what decides whether
/// they should be thrown away before the next decode.</item>
/// </list>
