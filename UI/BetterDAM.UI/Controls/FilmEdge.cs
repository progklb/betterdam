/// The perforated edge of a strip of film, for the contact sheet experiment.

/// Drawn where the layout already has a strip — the splitters between panes — and nowhere else.
/// Sprocket holes on every tile were the first idea and the wrong one: a grid of two hundred
/// frames would carry four hundred bright rectangles, all arguing with the photographs. A divider
/// is a strip whether or not it is dressed as one, so dressing it costs the pictures nothing.
///
/// The holes run along whichever axis is longer, so one control serves a column splitter and a
/// row splitter without being told which it is.
