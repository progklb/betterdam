/// itself which colour to draw a given string in. Adobe Bridge ships "Select, Second, Approved,
/// Review, To Do"; Lightroom ships "Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple". A file labelled in one shows
/// up in the other with the label intact but no colour, because the word does not match anything in
/// its own list. Lightroom offers a "Bridge compatible" label set for exactly this reason.
///
/// So the names are the interoperable part and they are editable here. Matching them to whatever
/// Bridge or Lightroom is set to is what makes labels travel; the colours never travel and are only
/// ever a local convenience.
