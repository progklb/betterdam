/// Tries each RAW decoder in turn.

/// No single decoder covers the formats a photographer actually has. LibRaw cannot unpack a JPEG XL
/// compressed DNG unless it was built against libjxl, which the usual packages are not; macOS
/// ImageIO cannot decode plenty of current cameras, including the Fujifilm X-S20. Between them the
/// coverage is good, and a file only falls back to its embedded preview when both fail.
///
/// Order matters: LibRaw first, because it is the one that answers to the develop settings. ImageIO
/// renders the file its own way, which is much better than a thumbnail but is not adjustable.
